## üì¶ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/odriew3j/authomatical.git
   cd authomatical

    Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux / Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Create a .env file in the project root:

OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key
WORDPRESS_URL=https://yourwordpress.com
WORDPRESS_USER=your_username
WORDPRESS_PASSWORD=your_password
MAX_RETRIES=3

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

    Ensure WordPress REST API is enabled and credentials are correct.

    OpenRouter does not currently support direct image generation (/images/generate). You may need another provider (e.g., Replicate, Stability AI)
